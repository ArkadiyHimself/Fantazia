Fantazia is my way to express my imagination using my artistic abilities and programming skills.

It adds several magical artifacts: spell casters which allow to use spells on yourself or creatures nearby, as well as auracasters, which allow you to create an aura around you that affects creatures inside it.

Aside of that, Fantazia also provides the player with a talent tree, althrough I'll admit that currently it is a bit empty :D
The talents provide player with either unique abilities or stat changes and can be obtained by either doing specific actions or "buying" them with the new "wisdom" currency. The talents are data based and talents which change attributes can be added by regular players
