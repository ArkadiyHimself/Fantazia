  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.duelist_ballista.page.1" : "Two crossbow enchantments which both make the weapon more deadly, although only against specific types of enemies, which makes both of them quite niche but rather effective in situations they're meant for",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.duelist_ballista.page.2" : "Duelist's effect is directly connected to its namesake, as it increases damage dealt to other range-attack enemies; at the same time Ballista is effective against flying enemies or even just those who are not standing on the ground",

  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.phasing.heading" : "Hatchet Enchantment",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.phasing.page.1" : "Not even those who dedicated their life to creating enchantments fully understand how exactly this one works; what is known is that this enchantment interacts with the spirit world allowing an inanimate object to enter it",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.phasing.page.2" : "Phasing warps the properties of a hatchet, making it intangible and ignore physical obstacles",

  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.ricochet.heading" : "Hatchet Enchantment",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.ricochet.page.1" : "Can inanimate objects have a mind of their own? Is it possible for something that is not alive to have will of its own? This enchantment is what makes some ask those questions",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.ricochet.page.2" : "As the name suggests, it makes hatchets ricochet from walls, but not the same way as a regular object would fly of the wall, but instead trying to find the nearest enemy nearby and flying towards it instead",

  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.name" : "Headshot",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.heading" : "Hatchet Enchantment",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.page.1" : "Is it not weird how most creatures have a weak spot? What is being talked about is the same spot that brain is located; striking someone's head can often lead to a swift death, so it makes even less sense to concentrate such an important part of the body in such a visible spot",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.page.2" : "Does what is says and says what it does. Drastically increases damage dealt to an enemy by a thrown hatchet, if it hit creature's head",

  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.heading" : "Melee Weapon",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.page.1" : "At first glance this blade made of glass does not look like anything special; most would think of it as weak and easily destructible, but be not deceived: it only starts as being weak, getting more powerful with each consecutive strike, until it reaches full potential. It should be kept in mind, however, that despite being magical, the blade is still as fragile as glass, as it loses its power when owner is harmed",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.page.2" : "Glass is known to be reflective, sure, but it can also be quite sharp; this property can too be influenced by magical essence, creating the fragile but sharp weapon",

  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.heading" : "Universal Weapon",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.page.1" : "A universal weapon useful for both melee and range attacks, although weaker in both situations than weapons created specifically for melee or range. Either way, it is a solid choice for those who do not have access to more powerful weapons",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.page.2" : "A rather simple recipe, combining a handle made of sticks with a small head made of regular materials"
