  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.ricochet.page.1" : "Can inanimate objects have a mind of their own? Is it possible for something that is not alive to possess will of its own? This enchantment is what makes some ask those questions",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.ricochet.page.2" : "As the name suggests, it makes hatchets ricochet from walls, but not the same way as a regular object would fly of the wall, but instead trying to find the nearest enemy nearby and flying towards it instead",

  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.name" : "Headshot!",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.heading" : "Hatchet Enchantment",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.page.1" : "Is it not weird how most creatures have a weak spot? What is being talked about is the same spot that brain is located; striking someone's head can often lead to a swift death, so it makes even less sense to concentrate such an important part of the body in such a visible spot",
  "book.fantazia.entry.enchantments.headshot.page.2" : "Does what is says and says what it does. Drastically increases damage dealt to an enemy by a thrown hatchet, if it hit creature's head",

  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.name" : "§5Fragile Blade",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.heading" : "Melee Weapon",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.page.1" : "At first glance this blade made of glass does not look like anything special; most would think of it as weak and easily destructible, but be not deceived: it only starts as being weak, getting more powerful with each consecutive strike, until it reaches full potential. It should be kept in mind, however, that despite being magical, the blade is still as fragile as glass, as it loses its power when owner is harmed",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.fragile_blade.page.2" : "Glass is known to be reflective, sure, but it can also be quite sharp; this property can too be influenced by magical essence, creating the fragile but sharp weapon",

  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.name" : "§cHatchets",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.heading" : "Universal Weapon",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.page.1" : "A universal weapon useful for both melee and range attacks, although weaker in both situations than weapons created specifically for melee or range. Either way, it is a solid choice for those who do not have access to more powerful weapons",
  "book.fantazia.entry.weapons.hatchets.page.2" : "A rather simple recipe, combining a handle made of sticks with a small head made of regular materials",

  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.name" : "The Worldliness",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.page.1" : "From one generation to another, from fathers to sons, from teachers to students, humanity has always been evolving, getting smarter, wiser and more intelligent. This progress of culture is constantly getting faster and faster, and the depth of one's knowledge a hundred tears ago is incomparable to what is known nowadays, and humanity constantly gets smarter than it was a moment ago",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.page.2" : "Of course, the knowledge always had a cost. Throughout our history, people have been constantly making mistakes which they learned from, some were screwed by life and were forced to adapt and evolve, for it is suffering that builds one's spirit. However, what emerges from those misfortunes is truly unstoppable and better than it used to be",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.page.3" : "But humans are still mortal, and life is still tragically short; the amount of thoughts one can make throughout their lifetime will always be finite and no one will ever know everything, for the world is limitless and will never be known completely. This is the exact reason for people to create persistent representation of their knowledge and wisdom in books and other forms of information",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.page.4" : "The knowledge was passed from one to another, from parent to child, to make life of the next generation ever so slightly easier than the previous one. This resulted in different nations getting different culture and different traditions and shaped people into who they are nowadays, whether they believe it or not",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.the_worldliness.page.5" : "The Worldliness is the culmination of all the knowledge of this world, carefully gathered from every human that has ever lived, their wisdom. Although the book starts with it being empty, it reveals more and more of itself as its owner explores the world",

  "book.fantazia.entry.world.fate.name" : "Fate",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.fate.page.1" : "Being present in most mythologies and legends, Fate always had place in the culture. Some stories revolved around embracing one's own fate and letting it guide you, others revolve around breaking free from the cruel grasp of fate and carving your own path. What doesn't change in any of those stories is the importance of Destiny and its influence on our life",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.fate.page.2" : "Although it might seem that the Fate is purely part of humans' life, it is in fact quite the opposite. Existing much, much earlier, perhaps since the beginning of everything, Fate was influencing all inanimate objects across the universe; it has been controlling the planets, stars, and even whole galaxies and nothing could escape its grasp, no matter how powerful and grand said cosmic body might seem to mortals...",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.fate.page.3" : "Star is destined to eventually become a dwarf and evaporate, a black hole is destined to lose their energy via radiation and eventually die out, a galaxy is destined to have all its stars fade away and eventually die itself, no cosmic body is free from its predetermined path, nor they have the will to overpower their destiny and become free. This is the difference between living and non-living",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.fate.page.4" : "Of course, Fate also tries to control living creatures, including humanity, but be not fooled for it is not, in fact, a natural part of our life; some may inherit a good life full of happiness, others may get a lifetime of misfortune and tragedy, but the fate is indifferent to humans' conditions and is unbothered by our troubles or joy, for we are but a small part of its grand schemes",

  "book.fantazia.entry.world.mind.name" : "Mind",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.mind.page.1" : "The universe is full of cosmic objects out of our comprehension: black holes, galaxies, nebulae, star clusters... All of them controlled by fate and destined to die eventually. No cosmic body, no matter how colossal it might seem, no matter its capabilities to warp space-time around itself, can escape what has been predetermined for it, for it has no capacity to do so",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.mind.page.2" : "Fate has no problem influencing non-living things because those lack any desire and will to resist it... but bodies with a will and a mind of their own?.. Sometimes people seem to forget how actually anomalous the life on our planet truly is; there are not many living creatures in the world, which makes those that exist in our universe special, including ourselves",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.mind.page.3" : "Maybe humans do not have entire planets or small stars orbiting around themselves, maybe they lack capacity to radiate immense energy every second or to distort the very fabric of reality with mere presence, but those possessing a mind have something no cosmic body has: an ability to choose what to do, means to obey one's own will instead of the cruel and indifferent predetermination",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.mind.page.4" : "The beginning of human civilisation and their capability for self-awareness gave birth to the new force, Mind, that rivals Fate and is a manifestation or people's desire to break free from the destiny and carve own path, shaping the world the way they wish, how they see fit. It is the culmination of humanity's collective mind, seeming to possess its own will",

  "book.fantazia.entry.world.chaos.name" : "Chaos",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.chaos.page.1" : "Despite being the opposites, Mind and Fate are actually not not that different from each other; they both try to shape the world and enforce the order upon it, just one has a purpose and the other is devoid of it. Both of them ultimately try to enforce a law on things, organize everything they can according to their vision, both lack any entropy",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.chaos.page.2" : "Still, the world seems to be very unorganized and chaotic, because it is. Born of the eternal conflict between two mentioned forces, Chaos is the embodiment of disorder and unpredictability, devoid of law, reason or purpose; not being the force of good, evil, or really anything, it just exists...",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.chaos.page.3" : "It is also unknown whether Chaos even has a will of its own, or it just acts the way it is meant to, but without others having capacity to know what is going to happen... What is known for sure, however, is that Chaos is as important and as big part of the world, as Mind or Fate, and it will prevail as long as Mind and Fate exist",

  "book.fantazia.entry.world.talents.name" : "Talents",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.talents.page.1" : "Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses; an artist has a capacity to turn an empty canvas into something great, a warrior is capable to protect those they care about, a farmer can provide people with food and resources needed to survive; everyone has a way to express their skill and passion towards their craft, that is how life works",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.talents.page.2" : "It does not even matter if those skills are given to someone from their birth or received as they grow up and learn about the world around them; after all, what is a talent if not something that has to be studied, mastered and perfected? In fact, any person can learn any skill, as long as they are willing to put their time and mind into it",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.talents.page.3" : "This is exactly how talents work for You, who is reading this. Any talent that is available can be learnt and sometimes even mastered, given enough effort, as they do not require one to be special. Some require to perform special rituals to obtain, some require enough intelligence and wisdom to be understood...",
  "book.fantazia.entry.world.talents.page.4" : "Of course, some of those talents are more... supernatural than the others; certain talents allow to do some relatively grounded and basic skills, while others change one's very traits, often giving them properties of other living beings..."
